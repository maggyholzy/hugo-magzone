Gosh, I'm just so excited to have this new website. It looks so simple and clean!!

This week, I'm going to work on a few personal projects (cycloidal drive), get my legal name change underway, and hopefully get a functional micro-spectrograph working for work. My excitement is beyond parallel.

More to come!
